            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>PHP Run is for running PHP scripts from WordPress Dashboard</p>
            <p>You don't need to write code in functions.php just to check some WP information (like all post meta). Just write code from WP Dashboard using this plugin.</p>
            <p>You can also process a lot of information in bulk mode (like making changes to posts).</p>
            <p>Aware! This plugin is for developers only. It has great functionality. If you don't know what you are doing, you can break your website.</p>

            <h2>How does this work?</h2>
            <p>There are 2 modes:</p>
            <p><strong>Simple</strong></p>
            <p>Just execute code you wrote to "PHP code" section and see results in "Output"</p>
            <p><strong>Advanced</strong></p>
            <p>This is a bulk mode. Get all IDs in "Initial data" section function php_run_load. Every ID will be passed to function php_run_process_single. That works in chunk mode, so you can process crazy amount of IDs (100 000+).</p>
